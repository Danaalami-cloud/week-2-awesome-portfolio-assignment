Greetings and Welcome to my ReadeMe, I'm Dana and I'm a recent graduate from the University of Manchester. I'm from Jerusalem, Palestine and studied four years abroad, three in MAnchester and one in Italy as part of my Degree. 
I'm challenging myself by learning web development and hopefully graduate the course with immense new knowledge and skills.

Code Work
I've added a couple of divs to the HTML code to help me narrow it down more when wrtitin it in CSS. The CSS code is a bit long, however, it makes the code funsction similarly to the mock up code. 

Links
I've used 5 links overall. The first three, are in the work section that opens in new tab when clicked on the picture. Two of them are from previous wrok before and during university, and the third one is my first project at boot camp.As for the last two links, they're for Github and my linkedin account.
